	    <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
      <p>
      <b>Namaste 🙏</b> 
      <br>
      <br>
      A guest speaker at my school said that he <b>hacked his college's website </b> and he could have <b>changed his grades</b>, but he didn't. Instead he reported to the college and got the issue resolved. The <b>6th grade me </b>didn't like this ending. He wanted to change the ending by getting a <b>gold medal</b> by changing his results and that is how it all began.
      <br><br>
      Long story short, I ended up reporting to the college authorities as well cz in the pursuit of becoming a hacker I fell in Love with computers and <b>To Love isn't to accomplish or to conquer. To love, is just to love.</b> 
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>Two truths and a lie: </i>I have worked as a <b>Process Engineering Scientist</b> in a pharmaceutical company, I have worked on <b>cancer drug development research</b> and I didn't clear GATE, instead <b>I hacked my way into IITB.</b>
      <br>
I am deeply interested in systems programming, networks, understanding computer architecture and operating systems. 
<br>
<br>
Beyond computers, I enjoy <b>Badminton🏸, Swimming🏊‍♀️,Singing and Playing Guitar🎸.
Let's connect if we have stuff in common, or even if we don't. Do send me your nvim and tmux configs if you think you have got one superior than me(I use arch btw). I hope you enjoyed your stay on my page. 
<br>
<br>
Hasta luego👋
